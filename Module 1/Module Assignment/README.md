# Assignment Overview

Find an online video that showcases a mobile robot in action and write a short text about it. In the text, you need to describe the type of the robot, its main task and why that task is relevant. For instance, how could that robot potentially improve human life? Further, identify one major difficulty that the robot might face to reach its goal, i.e., why is the task non-trivial? or what are the safety concerns? Finally, briefly outline what method or technology was deployed to overcome that obstacle, or, if that is not clear from the video, name a state-of-the-art solution for the problem. You can take the description of the [Shakey video](https://youtu.be/GmU7SimFkpU) as inspiration. Try not to pick the most obvious videos, you will be given an extra point for originality!

As the final part of the assignment, please post the link to your video and your text on the discussion board. Then, look at the videos and texts of other participants. Choose one of the videos posted by your fellow students that seem most interesting to you. Explain in a few sentences what you find interesting about it and why.


 ## Guidelines

Please post the link to the video that you found and your text on the discussion board until Nov 17, 2022, 11:59 PM. Note that you will not be able to see the contributions of other participants until you post yours. The video has to be freely accessible and no longer than 3 minutes. In case you want to show a part of a longer video, please also share the corresponding timestamps. The text has to be 10-15 sentences long. Your comments on other videos should focus on the subject matter of the module, i.e., the robot design, the robot's task, interesting solution to a problem, etc. The due date for posting comments is Nov 20, 11:59 PM.
